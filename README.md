The website we have chosen to scrape is https://www.otodom.pl. On this website, we will filter for "homes for sale in Mazowieckie region" and begin the scraping here. 

The information we will be scraping is the title of the listing, the location of the home, and the price using BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, and Selenium.


</br> To run BeautifulSoup： </br> </br>

type “python3 otodombs.py” in the terminal


</br> To run: Scrapy： </br> </br>

Type “scrapy crawl allhomes -o output.xlsx” in the pycharm terminal.


</br> To run Selenium: </br> </br>

type “python3 selenium.py” in the terminal
